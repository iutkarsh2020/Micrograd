Hey there!\
This repository is a version of Micrograd which is used in Pytorch to carry out Deeplearning trainings. The module basically encapsulates any data and possible transformation on the data in a wrapper class - 'Value'
It abstracts away the Value class and uses it to create a neural net, train it using different activations and uses back propogation to converge to a optimal solution.
